# Implementation-of-Minesweeper Game

We play on a square board and we have to click on the board on the cells which do not have a mine. And obviously we don’t know where mines are. If a cell where a mine is present is clicked then we lose, else we are still in the game. There are three levels for this game- Child – 9 * 9 Board and 10 Mines Teenager – 16 * 16 Board and 40 Mines Adult – 24 * 24 Board and 99 Mines

Implementation:

Two implementations of the game are given here:

In the first implementation, the user’s move is selected randomly using rand() function.
In the second implementation, the user himself select his moves using scanf() function.
